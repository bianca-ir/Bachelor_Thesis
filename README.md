# Bachelor_Thesis

This repository contains the code and resources for my final undergraduate thesis: *Exploring factors affecting the performance of machine learning algorithms in medical image classification*. The objective of this research was to investigate the performance of Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Convolutional Neural Network in the context of image classification. The thesis focused on evaluating the impact of different preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods, and hyperparameter tuning on the model performance.

The app allows the user to upload a mammogram and get two possible predictions - benign or malignant - for the uploaded image based on a few model configurations.
